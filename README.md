# ï£¿ Welcome to Rococoa

Rococoa is a generic Java binding to the Mac Objective-C object system. It 
allows the creation and use of Objective-C objects in Java, and the 
implementation of Objective-C interfaces in Java.

## Fair Warning

Rococoa is very much work in progress. Much is subject to change. A lot isn't
good enough not to change. But given the recent deprecation of the Java-Cocoa 
bridge, it's the best I've got. Just mind your head. And please give
[feedback](https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList)

Oh, one big warning. Rococoa on PPC passes all but one of its tests, but that
shows that it has an 
[issue](https://github.com/umjammer/rococoa/issues)
returning longs from Objective-C methods. Please do
try it on PPC, and 
[let me know](https://rococoa.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList)
any other problems.
