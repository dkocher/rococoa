<h1>Welcome to Rococoa</h1>

<p>Rococoa is a generic Java binding to the Mac Objective-C object system. It 
allows the creation and use of Objective-C objects in Java, and the 
implementation of Objective-C interfaces in Java.</p>

<p>I've not quite published this thing yet, so bear with me. Bits might be done 
though, so feel free to look around. Just mind your head.</p>

<em>Fair Warning</em>

<p>Rococoa is very much work in progress. Much is subject to change. A lot isn't
good enough not to change. But given the recent deprecation of the Java-Cocoa 
bridge, it's the best I've got</p>
