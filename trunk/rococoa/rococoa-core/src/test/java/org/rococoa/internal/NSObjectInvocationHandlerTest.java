     * We test for the case when the init method is not able to complete the initialization
     * In such a case,, the init... method could free the receiver and return nil, indicating that
     * the requested object canâ€™t be created.
     * <p/>
     * Therefore, Rococoa should not release such instances.
     * <p/>
     * Example:
     * NSImage *img = [NSImage alloc];
     * This instance can be released using [img release]
     * [img initWithData:nil];
     * The following would lead to a crash because the initializer above fails
     * [img release];
     * <p/>
     * NSObjectInvocationHandler therefore must make sure to not release an
     * object on finalization when there was an error in initialization and the receiver
     * is already freed according to the recommendation in the documentation.
     * <p/>
     * Summary: If nil is returned from a initializer, one must assume the object is already released
     *
